<h2>Modes</h2>
<p>
The game has three modes to choose from. They are Human VS Human, Human VS AI and AI VS AI modes. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Human VS Human:</b>
<br>
In the beginning white side always starts first. First left click the piece you want to move and then left click the
square you want the piece to move. As you click the piece you can see that the piece is selected when it has blue background.
You can also note that all possible moves have orange background. That helps you to choose quick where to move the piece.
When the first human player has made a turn then it's the other side's turn.
<br>
Tip: Press right mouse button to cancel the selected piece and choose other piece instead.
</p>
<p>
<b>Human VS AI:</b>
<br>
Human is the white side and it's also the starting side. As you move your piece similarly than in Human VS Human mode,
you can see that computer moves it's piece as soon as you have moved your's.
</p>
<b>AI VS AI:</b>
<br>
Press mouse button and both computer players move at the same time one turn at a time.
